#  Simulation of N=variable active particles interacting with the 
#  soft-core potential confined inside a circle of glued particles


# All runtime messages will be sent to file messages.msg
messages messages.msg

# Every simulation requires a box
# "periodic" means that periodic boundary are applied.
# box is cubic with size 100x100x10 (units of particle radius r = 1) and spans from -50 to 50 in 
# x and y directions and -5 to 5 in z direction
# This is essentially dummy; just make sure it's big enough
box periodic { lx = 500.0;  ly = 500.0;  lz = 10.0 }

# We read in particle positions from file circle.dat (generated by tools in utils directory)
input plane_circle_cornea.txt

# We set the neighbour list with cutoff distance 2.4 and padding distance of 0.5
# Longer for gaussian: reaches out till 3
nlist { rcut = 3.2; pad = 0.5 }

# The particles are divided into three groups: group 1 is moving, group 2 are the glued stem cells and group 3 is the glued boundary
group g1 { type = 1 }
group g2 { type = 2 }
group g3 { type = 3 }

# In following we define different data outputs

# Output particle velocities. Base name of the file is plane_test
# File extension will we '.vel'. Output will be generated every 10000 time steps
# staring from the step 0. Each snapshots will be stored in a separate file (keyword 'multi')
# with name plane_test_[time_step].vel (e.g., plane_test_0000010000.vel)
# and each file with contain a header with the description of its content
# dump circle_test { type=velocity; start=0; freq=10000; multi; header }

# Same as above, but the format will be XYZ and file extension '.xyz'
# dump circle_test { type=xyz; start=0; freq=10000; multi; header }

# In order to generate a trajectory, we output coordinates every 1000 time steps
# In this case all snapshots will be stored in one file 'plane_test.dcd'
# dump circle_test { type=dcd; start=0; freq=1000  }

# We also want to generate a director field file that can be directly visualized by SimRePlay
# In this case all snapshots will be stored in one file 'plane_test_dir.xyzv'
# dump circle_test_dir { type=xyzv; start=0; freq=1000; scale = 0.25; header  }

# In addition we want to generate a velocity field file that can be directly visualized by SimRePlay
# In this case all snapshots will be stored in one file 'plane_test_vel.xyzv'
# dump circle_test_vel { type=xyzv; start=0; freq=1000; scale = 0.1; velocity; header  }


# Finally, every 10000 steps we generate a separate file that contains 
# particle coordinates, velocities anf the director field (and the header)
dump plane_circle_test { type=full; start=0; freq=2000; multi; id; flag; tp; radius; coordinate; velocity; director; header  }


# We constrain all particles to move only on the xy plane with lx=100, ly = 100 (actually those are read from the box)

# k = 1.0 (energy units)

# Alignment will be done using polar aligner 
# Coupling constant J = 1.0 (energy units)
pair_align polar { J = 1.0 }

# We would also like to monitor measure a few quantities
# Here we define a log that keeps track of step, velocity, soft core potenetial energy, and alignment 
# These quantities will be logged once every 1000 steps
# Note that step is always logged automatically

# Now we are at the point to execute actual simulations.
