This is an example for active filaments. 

In order to run it, the user first needs to:

1) create a single filament with make_filament.py script.
2) edit make_many.inp (this is a configuration file for packmol)
3) run packmol on make_many.inp (packmol can be downladed from
http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~martinez/packmol/home.shtml)
4) run make_filaments.py script to produce multiple filaments.
